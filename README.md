# Basic Angular Template

Authored by @ryanosaur

User this light weight template to get off the ground quick with angular. Setup to easily deploy to heroku with postinstall script.

To get started:
```bash
npm install
```
This will get all your dependancies, install the bower dependancies and also run the gulp build task to concat/copy all your files to a public directory.

For development:
```bash
gulp
```
The default gulp task will concat/compile/copy all the source files into a public folder and spin up a server with livesync.

Have fun!
